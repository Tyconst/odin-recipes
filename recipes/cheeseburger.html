          <ul>
            <li>1 hamburger bun, split</li>
            <li>1/3 pound ground beef</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt</li>
            <li>4 processed cheese singles &lpar;such as Kraft&rpar;</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon thousand island salad dressing &lpar;such as Kraft&rpar;</li>
            <li>1 slice tomato</li>

            <li>Preheat a large skillet over medium heat. Place hamburger bun halves, cut-sides down,

            <li>Cook patties in the same large skillet over medium heat for 2 to 3 minutes. Flip patties over and place 2 cheese slices over each patty. Continue cooking until desired doneness is reached, 2 to 3 minutes more. 
                An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of patties should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C) for well done.</li>
            <li>Assemble cheeseburger in the following order: bottom bun, dressing, tomato, lettuce, beef patty with cheese, onion, beef patty with cheese, and top bun.</li>

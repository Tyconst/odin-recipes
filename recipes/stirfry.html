                <p>A bowl of steak and broccoli with rice.</p>

            <p>A classic steak and broccoli stir-fry features tender, thinly sliced beef and vibrant, crisp-tender broccoli florets, stir-fried quickly in a hot pan or wok. The steak is typically cut against the grain to ensure tenderness, often marinated in a combination of soy sauce, cornstarch, and other seasonings to enhance flavor and promote a silky texture.</p>
            <p>The broccoli is usually cooked to a crisp-tender texture, often achieved through quick stir-frying, steaming, or blanching, retaining its vibrant green color and maximizing nutrient retention.</p>
            <p>The dish is brought together by a savory and flavorful stir-fry sauce. This sauce often includes ingredients like soy sauce, oyster sauce (for umami depth), beef broth, sesame oil, ginger, garlic, and a touch of sweetness from ingredients like honey or brown sugar. A cornstarch slurry is often added to thicken the sauce, creating a glossy coating for the beef and broccoli.</p>
